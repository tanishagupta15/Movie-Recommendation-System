# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is a content-based recommendation system which similar movies in its database and calculates similarity scores based on the user's preference.

The project flow is as follows:
   1)Dataset uploading - I have picked a dataset from Kaggle.
   2)Jupyter notebook setup - Importing necessary librarires(Numpy, Pandas, ast, nltk, sklearn, pickle).
   3)Data Preprocessing - Transforming the raw data into the required format for creating tags to extract information.
   4)Vectorization - Converting the tags to vector to calculate the distance betweeen them using cosine similarity.
   5)Main function - recommending the top five movies based on the distance calculated in the previous step.
   6)Frontend/Streamlit - using Streamlit library for creating website.
